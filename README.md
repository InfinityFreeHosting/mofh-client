# MyOwnFreeHost API Client

An API client to use the free hosting system from [MyOwnFreeHost](https://myownfreehost.net).

**IMPORTANT: THIS LIBRARY IS AIMED AT EXPERIENCED PHP DEVELOPERS. Experience with object-oriented PHP and Composer is required. If you can't use oo-PHP and Composer, don't bother with this library.**

## Installation
